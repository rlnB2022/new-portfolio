			"<p>Having never used Firebase/Firestorm before, I took it as a challenge. (I love learning new things!) Reading through the Firestorm docs and walking through the setup process on their website wasn't too difficult.</p><p>I had an issue with too many renderings when I implement the Timer component from App.js. Instead of counting down from 30 when the game starts and the question is revealed, it began immediately. I moved the logic to the Timer component and that helped tremendously.</p><p>I used SVG images for each question/answer. I ran into a problem where the SVGs wouldn't resize to fit the grid. I replaced the SVGs with simple borders/border-radius styles applied. I understand that the viewbox setting in the SVG might be the culprit. I'll have to learn more about using SVGs to understand how to implement something like this in the future.</p>",
			"<p>I learned that React is the library that was just made for me. I love it! Firestore databases are amazing. Coming from a SQL background, a noSQL database with documents wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Implementing React Redux to manage the state of the app was also not as difficult as I expected, either. At my current job, we used Flux, so it was easy to adapt and learn.</p>",

			"<p>This website was created for a specific gaming niche, Tabletop Baseball Gaming. These games use baseball player cards and dice. Games like Strat-O-matic, APBA, Payoff Pitch, etc. all fit into this category. They also all have the same exact issue which is the immense amount of time that it takes to set the game up. This is where I got the idea to create DigiDugout.com.</p><br /><ul><li>mySQL database with tables for all players that have ever played the game along with the lineups for each game ever played</li><li>Custom calendar with month and year selectors.</li><li>Team names displayed with color-coded background and fonts.</li><li>View, at a glance, the real-life winning and losing pitchers as well as who earned the save. Also displays the runs, hits and errors.</li><li>View the lineups for each team</li><li>'Print scoresheet' button will popup a pdf file for printing.</li><li>Lineups and starting pitchers are pre-filled</li></ul>",
			"<ul><li>PHP</li><li>Javascript</li><li>jQuery</li><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>AJAX</li></ul>",
			"<p>My goal was simple. Create a website where users don't have to do any online research; they don't have to write the lineups and starting pitchers on a blank score sheet by hand; they can just find the game and click print score sheet.</p><p>I knew what I wanted to build. I knew who my audience was and why they would want to use this resource. I just didn't know what Tech to use to accomplish my goals.</p><p>So, I did some research. Mainly into how to access a database from a website that I would create. I stumbled across some YouTube videos on PHP that showed how to connect, read, update, and delete data. It seemed fairly simple so I moved forward.</p><p>Next, I looked into web-hosting and found that there were cheap hosting services that used phpMyAdmin, so I went with it. From that point forward, I was learning PHP 'on-the-job'. I used php.net/docs often, as well as StackOverflow and standard Google searches to find what I was looking for.</p><p>I went through a number of iterations on the design for the website before settling on the current version. I really just wanted the website to be simple to use and straight to the point. I used lined-notebooks and blank sheets of copy paper to draw out ideas. It wasn't until many months later that I discovered Figma, but never used it with this project.</p>",
			"<p>In the beginning, I struggled to get things to work as intended as I was completely new to PHP, AJAX and jQuery. It took a monumental effort to learn these technologies during the development process.</p><p>I learned a lot with this project. New tech, new methods of fetching data, and I even learned that if you don't like the way built-in Date Objects work, I can make my own.</p><p>I'm certain the code can be improved upon, but I'm super proud of the work I did on this!</p><p>Throughout the development process, I continued to learn not only about PHP, but jQuery and AJAX. I learned that they go hand-in-hand and this allowed me to fetch data without reloading the page. I thought that was so cool!</p>",
